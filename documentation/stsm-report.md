# STSM report

## Introduction

This is a report for a Short Term Scientific Mission (STSM) for the [COST Action ES1305](http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/essem/Actions/ES1305): *European Network for the Radar surveillance of Animal Movement (ENRAM)* under working group 3: *[Visualizing spatio-temporal patterns of animal movement](www.enram.eu/working-group-3/)*.

* **STSM title**: Bird migration visualization hackathon
* **Host institution**: [Research Group of Computational Geo-Ecology](http://ibed.uva.nl/research/research-groups/research-groups/research-groups/content/folder/computational-geo-ecology/computational-geo-ecology.html) at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands under the coordination of Dr. Judy Shamoun-Baranes.
* **Grantee**: Peter Desmet, Bart Aelterman, Kevin Azijn from the [LifeWatch team](http://lifewatch.inbo.be) at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) in Belgium.
* **Dates**: June 2 to 6, 2014

## Purpose

The goal of this STSM is threefold:

1. To create a usable case study dataset of a multiday bird migration event, based on data recorded by 5 weather radars (and possibly 2 military radars) in Belgium and the Netherlands, and reference weather data.
2. To develop an open source prototype of a flow visualization (similar to [http://air.nullschool.net/](http://air.nullschool.net/)), using this dataset.
3. To publicly document the dataset and prototype as guidelines for a data challenge to be organized in 2015. The aim and structure of this data challenge will also be set during this STSM.
